A collection of numerical python recipes
========================================

###DiscreteOptionPricing
Contains functions and classes to compute financial derivatives using discrete pricing theory.

###DiscreteSDE
Robust classes/methods to simulate stochastic differential equations using a discretization scheme.

###MachineLearningScikitLearn
Some scikit-learn-friendly machine learning classes.

###MultinomialMarkovAndEncoding
Create a multinomial markov chain (plus some awesome sampling and conditional sampling algos) from encoded data.
