A collection of numerical python recipes
========================================

###Damerau-Lenenshtein Distance
An implementation of the DL distance, used to measure the "distance" (as defined by number of deletions, substitutions, transpositions and insertaions) between two strings. I use it to detect swear words and their misspellings.


###Discrete Option Pricing
Contains functions and classes to compute financial derivatives using discrete pricing theory. Mostly recursion.

###Discrete SDE
Robust classes/methods to simulate stochastic differential equations using a discretization scheme. Includes Euler, Milstein and Second-Order scheme. To be implemented into PyProcess.

###Machine Learning Scikit Learn
Some scikit-learn-friendly machine learning classes. 

###Monte Carlo
A collection of tools to sample from a variety of distributions and evaluating integrals. Include bivariate copula sampling, markov chain monte carlo, and numerical integration (with variance reduction support). 

###Multinomial Markov And Encoding
Create a multinomial markov chain (plus some awesome sampling and conditional sampling algos) from encoded data. See my [password analysis](http://www.camdp.com/blogs/modeling-password-creation) for a use and creation of it.

###Numerical Derivatives
Compute the derivative of functions a points using discrete schemes. Has a great recursive solution to solving problem:
>> Given a multivariate CDF, how can I computationally, and efficiently, find its pdf?

This problem occurs in copula sampling often. 


###Time Series Association Rules
A Framework to find association rules from human-generated features in time series. A work in progress, but pretty cool so far.


###utils
Some nice utils to have around.
